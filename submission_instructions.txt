Submission Instructions The Shared Task for Euphemism Detection

1. Your submission must be a .zip file containing a single file named "answer.txt". The name of the .zip file should not matter, but "answer.zip" is a safe choice.
2. "answer.txt" must contain a row for each index in the test set (i.e. it should contain 393 lines).
3. Each line should consist of an index number, followed by a comma, followed by the label. For example, the first line of your submisison might look like this:

0,1

which means the text for index 0 has a label of 1 (is euphemistic). 

So, your "answer.txt" should look something like this:

0,1
1,0
2,1
3,0
4,1
...
390,1
391,0
392,1

Remember to zip your .txt file into a .zip file, and to submit the .zip file!
